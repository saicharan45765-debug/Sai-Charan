<p align="left"><strong>The Golden Egg</strong><br></p>
Once upon a time, a farmer had a goose that laid a golden egg every day. The farmer used to sell that egg and earn enough money to meet their family's day-to-day needs. One day, the farmer thought that if he could get more such golden eggs and make a lot of money and become a wealthy <em>person</em>. The farmer decided to cut the goose <u>and remove</u> all the golden eggs from its stomach. As soon as they killed the bird and opened the gooseâ€™s stomach, they found no eggs. The foolish farmer realized they had destroyed their last resource out of greed.
